Check `report.pdf` for your information. If you have troubles building or running this project, please contact me through posting an issue or email.

Note that since the presentation slides are too large (over 200MB since containing videos), I uploaded `PDF`Â version instead of `KEY` file. Kindly contact me if you want that.

Thanks for visiting!

## Update

- Uploaded a initial view of the coursework into this `README.md` to illustrate it better at your first view.
- Uploaded the project description document FYI.
- Uploaded my ~~naive~~ project proposal.

My entire module has got 67/100. Details and feedbacks are not provided for this coursework, thanks to the module convenor Dr Poon. 

My sincere suggestion for UNNC CS students is that **do not select this CG module** unless you don't want to have exams. You may kindly contact me via baisebaoma@foxmail.com if you want to know the reasons and I am very happy to respond.

**Select Compilers! Dr Amin is good!**

Good luck everyone!
